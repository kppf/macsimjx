<h1><a class="anchor" name="server_index">MACSim Library: Server Section</a></h1><h2><a class="anchor" name="server_intro">
Introduction</a></h2>
This is a sub-project of the MACSim library, which is intended to aid programmers in creating multi-agent simulations for direct interfacing to Matlab and Simulink, both created by <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">The MathWorks</a>. Simulink does not seem to support multi-threading in Simulink blocks written in C or C++. This problem has been identified though painful experimentation.<p>
MACSim exists in two parts: <ul>
<li>a client which appears as a Simulink s-function block called MACSim; </li>
<li>a server, written as a library which a programmer may incorporate into their own code.</li>
</ul>
The server runs as a separate process from the client, communicating via named pipes. Communication is asynchronous to other server processes allowing the server to be multi-threaded.<p>
Two servers are currently provided as part of the full MACSim package: a C++ server and a Java server, known as server and jserver respectively. An agent library is also provided allowing easy construction of a multi-agent system in C++. It assumed that users of the jserver can utilise any one of the large number of existing agent frameworks for Java.<p>
The MACSim client uses Lee Netherton's SimClassLib and both the client and server use his MatrixClassLib as well.<h2><a class="anchor" name="server_usage">
Server Usage</a></h2>
No changes need be made to the server code in order to use it. To create an operating server a class must be created which inherits from <a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_server_interface.html">MACSimServerInterface</a>. <a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_server_interface.html">MACSimServerInterface</a> defines four pure virual member functions which return key information for configuring the server and operating the simulation. To create a server, the server class (<a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_server.html">MACSimServer</a>) must be instantiated, passing an instance of the <a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_server_interface.html">MACSimServerInterface</a> to the constructor.<p>
The <a class="el" href="class_simple.html">Simple</a> class defined in <a class="el" href="simple_8cpp.html">simple.cpp</a> provides an example of the use of <a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_server_interface.html">MACSimServerInterface</a> and the <a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_server.html">MACSimServer</a> server class.<h2><a class="anchor" name="server_structure">
Server Structure</a></h2>
The primary server class is <a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_server.html">MACSimServer</a>. This utilises two other classes, one for each of the two asynchronous named pipes the server provides. <a class="el" href="class_config_server.html">ConfigServer</a> defines the configuration pipe and <a class="el" href="class_sim_server.html">SimServer</a> defines the simulation pipe. Each of these classes inherit their basic functionality from the <a class="el" href="class_server.html">Server</a> class, which defines basic asynchronous named pipe behaviour. asynchronicity comes from the <a class="el" href="class_thread.html">Thread</a> class which provides a class-encapsulated windows thread.<p>
The data sent down the pipe is all gathered from the class which defines <a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_server_interface.html">MACSimServerInterface</a>.<h2><a class="anchor" name="server_doc">
This Documentation</a></h2>
This documentation is primarily intended for those wanting to implement a MACSim server. It should also provide a starting point for maintainers of the MACSim server library and for those interested in its operation. <hr size="1"><address style="align: right;"><small>Generated on Wed Mar 9 16:07:32 2005 for MACSim Library by&nbsp;
