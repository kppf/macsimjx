<h1><a class="anchor" name="client_index">MACSim Library: Client Section</a></h1><h2><a class="anchor" name="client_intro">
Introduction</a></h2>
This is a sub-project of the MACSim library, which is intended to aid programmers in creating multi-agent simulations for direct interfacing to Matlab and Simulink, both created by <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/">The MathWorks</a>. Simulink does not seem to support multi-threading in Simulink blocks written in C or C++. This problem has been identified though painful experimentation.<p>
MACSim exists in two parts: <ul>
<li>a client which appears as a Simulink s-function block called MACSim; </li>
<li>a server, written as a library which a programmer may incorporate into their own code.</li>
</ul>
The server runs as a separate process from the client, communicating via named pipes. Communication is asynchronous to other server processes allowing the server to be multi-threaded.<p>
Two servers are currently provided as part of the full MACSim package: a C++ server and a Java server, known as server and jserver respectively. An agent library is also provided allowing easy construction of a multi-agent system in C++. It assumed that users of the jserver can utilise any one of the large number of existing agent frameworks for Java.<p>
The MACSim client uses Lee Netherton's SimClassLib and both the client and server use his MatrixClassLib as well.<h2><a class="anchor" name="client_usage">
Client Usage</a></h2>
No changes need be made to the client code in order to use it. All configuration data required by Simulink is obtained from the server. A precompiled binary file (a DLL) is present in the client/bin directory. To use the client, ensure that this directory is on your Matlab path and then add an S-function block to your Simulink model with the name <code>MACSim</code>. No parameters are necessary. The server sub-projects contain examples Simulink models and associated servers.<h2><a class="anchor" name="client_doc">
This Documentation</a></h2>
This documentation is intended for maintainers of the client sub-project and for those who are interested in how the client works. There are two important classes in the client: <ul>
<li>The <a class="el" href="class_m_a_c_sim_client.html">MACSimClient</a> class inherits from the Sim class which is part of SimClassLib. This class creates the Simulink block with one set of inputs and outputs using fixed-period discrete timing. </li>
<li>The <a class="el" href="class_client.html">Client</a> class implements a pipe client for the two MACSim pipes. It caches configuration data for more efficient operation. </li>
</ul>
