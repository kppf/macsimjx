ATF Name: Simple agent example.

Desc: Although all data from Simulink is forwarded to every agent 
by the AgentCoordinator, here we are assuming each agent has its own associated signal. 
Therefore, each agent only extracts their relevant element of data, share it with the other 
agent, do their arithmetic and send the new data back to Simulink, again via the AgentCoordinator.

In Simulink, use example.mdl.

Agent: 1 
Name: ssa
Class path in package: example.SimpleSummationAgent

Agent: 2 
Name: sda
Class path in package: example.SimpleDifferenceAgent

MACSim inputs: 2, outputs: 2, sample rate (Hz):100
